# Block-scaled FP8 GEMM on gfx90a: it needs a decoder, not a tuning config

**Date**: 2026-07-27
**Hardware**: 2x AMD Instinct MI210 (gfx90a / CDNA2), 64 GB HBM2e each
**Software**: ROCm 7.14.0, PyTorch 2.11.0, amd-aiter 0.1.17, vLLM 0.23.0, Triton 3.x, Python 3.14

This answers two questions left open by
[`benchmarks/vllm-aiter-asm-gfx90a.md`](../benchmarks/vllm-aiter-asm-gfx90a.md)
part 3, which found that a block-quantized FP8 checkpoint runs correctly on an
MI210, keeps its 1.75x weight-memory saving, preserves the ASM attention
kernels — and serves 10-15x slower, because the only reachable FP8 GEMM peaks
at 8.3 TFLOP/s against bf16's ~96.

1. Is AITER's `AiterFp8BlockScaledMMKernel` dequant-based, and therefore
   something gfx90a could run, or does it need FP8 arithmetic?
2. That doc concluded the blocker was a missing tuning config, since vLLM names
   the exact missing file. Is that right?

**The answers are "dequant-based, but it is a Triton kernel here, so enabling it
gains nothing structural" and "no".** The gap is not tiling. gfx90a lacks an FP8
*decode* instruction, so Triton emulates `e4m3 -> fp16` in software at ~29 VALU
ops per value, and that emulation — not the matmul — is the kernel.

Replacing the emulation with a 3-op bit reinterpretation, which is **exact** for
every byte a block-quantized checkpoint can contain, makes the same kernel
5.5-6x faster with no tuning at all.

## Headline results

1. **AITER's block-scaled FP8 GEMM does not need FP8 hardware.** It loads FP8,
   converts in registers, and does the MFMA in fp16 — `v_mfma_f32_16x16x16f16`,
   with **zero** FP8 or BF8 opcodes anywhere in the generated code. It runs on
   gfx90a and is numerically exact.

2. **But on gfx90a it is not the CK or ASM kernel.** `gemm_a8w8_blockscale`
   checks `_hip_blockscale_supported()`, whose arch list is
   `{gfx940, gfx941, gfx942, gfx950}`, and falls back to *aiter's own Triton
   kernel*. Enabling `AiterFp8BlockScaledMMKernel` on gfx90a therefore swaps one
   Triton kernel for another. It is not a route to hand-written ASM.

3. **The real bottleneck is FP8 decoding, not tiling.** vLLM's kernel is 11,997
   instructions, of which **64 are MFMA** and **7,106 are `v_cmp_ne_u16` /
   `v_cndmask_b32`** — the software emulation of an IEEE-correct `e4m3 -> fp16`
   conversion. gfx942 does this with `v_cvt_pk_f32_fp8`; gfx90a has no such
   instruction.

4. **The emulation cost is specific to e4m3.** Decoding 4 values costs 117 VALU
   ops for e4m3 (both OCP `fn` and AMD `fnuz`), against **11** for e5m2 and 11
   for int8 — both of which gfx90a decodes with a shift. e4m3's 4-bit exponent
   has to be re-biased and its denormals handled; e5m2's exponent field is
   already fp16-shaped.

5. **A bit-trick decode is exact and removes the storm.** 11,997 instructions
   drop to 3,954 and the cmp/cndmask count drops from 7,106 to 194, with the
   same 64 MFMA doing the same arithmetic. Bit-exact on all 254 non-NaN e4m3
   byte patterns.

6. **Tuning helps too, but far less than the decode fix**, and the two compose.
   Tuning alone takes the stock kernel from 12.6x slower than bf16 to 4.1x; the
   decode fix *untuned* already beats the fully tuned stock kernel; together
   they reach 0.59-1.78x of bf16.

7. **In serving this is worth 8.6-10.8x.** `Qwen/Qwen3-14B-FP8` on one MI210
   goes from 2.7 to **29.2 tok/s** at 128 tokens / concurrency 1, and TPOT from
   373 ms to 33.7 ms. Across the full 128/4096 x 1/8/32 grid FP8 now serves at
   **0.67-0.85x of bf16** while using 1.75x less weight memory and fitting 1.45x
   more KV — where it was 0.07x before.

9. **CK is not an alternative.** Its block-scaled FP8 GEMM *does* build for
   gfx90a (315 s) and is dequant-based — 12,288 `v_mfma_f32_16x16x4f32`, zero
   FP8 opcodes — but it computes **exactly one quarter** of the correct sum,
   plus NaNs, because its non-gfx94 fallback feeds one scalar per lane to a K=4
   matrix instruction. Even repaired it would run on **fp32** MFMA at ~45
   TFLOP/s against the 181 Triton reaches via fp16.

8. **At decode, FP8 is faster than bf16**, which the shared-181-TFLOP/s argument
   does not predict: decode is bound by streaming weights, not by arithmetic,
   and FP8 weights are half the bytes. At M=1 `gate_up_proj` the fast kernel
   runs at **0.59x of bf16's time**.

---

## 1. What does AITER's FP8 block GEMM actually dispatch to?

vLLM's `AiterFp8BlockScaledMMKernel.apply_block_scaled_mm`
(`vllm/model_executor/kernels/linear/scaled_mm/aiter.py:401`) picks between two
aiter entry points:

```python
if self.use_triton:
    gemm_a8w8_blockscale_op = rocm_aiter_ops.triton_gemm_a8w8_blockscale
else:
    gemm_a8w8_blockscale_op = rocm_aiter_ops.gemm_a8w8_blockscale
```

`use_triton` requires `is_triton_gemm_w8a8_tuned(n, k)`, a hardcoded list of 11
`(N, K)` pairs — none of which are Qwen3-14B's — so a Qwen3-14B FP8 checkpoint
takes the second branch.

That branch is not the CK kernel either. In
`aiter/ops/gemm_op_a8w8.py:775`:

```python
if not _hip_blockscale_supported():
    # No CK code object for this arch -> triton
    from aiter.ops.triton.gemm.basic.gemm_a8w8_blockscale import (
        gemm_a8w8_blockscale as _gemm_a8w8_blockscale_triton,
    )
    ...
    return _gemm_a8w8_blockscale_triton(xq, wq, x_scale, w_scale, dtype=dtype)
```

with

```python
_BLOCKSCALE_HIP_PREBUILT_ARCHES = frozenset({"gfx940", "gfx941", "gfx942", "gfx950"})
```

Measured on the card:

```
aiter get_gfx()             : gfx90a
prebuilt arches             : ['gfx940', 'gfx941', 'gfx942', 'gfx950']
_hip_blockscale_supported() : False
```

`module_gemm_a8w8_blockscale` is also absent from aiter's prebuilt `.so` set —
only the non-blockscale `module_gemm_a8w8.so` ships — so there is no gfx90a code
object to load, exactly as the fallback comment says.

**So both branches of `AiterFp8BlockScaledMMKernel` land in Triton on gfx90a.**
Opening the gate PR #12 closed would not expose a hand-written FP8 kernel,
because none exists for this arch. That is the direct answer to the question
that motivated the gate.

### What about CK? It builds, and it is broken

CK picks its matrix instruction by operand type, and for `f8_t` the selection
has no CDNA2 case
(`composable_kernel/include/ck/tensor_operation/gpu/warp/xdlops_gemm.hpp:1576`)
— everything that is not RDNA3/RDNA4 falls through to
`mfma_f32_16x16x32f8f8`. The assembler rejects that for gfx90a:

| instruction | gfx90a | gfx942 |
|---|---|---|
| `v_mfma_f32_16x16x32_fp8_fp8` (what CK selects for `f8_t`) | **REJECTED** | OK |
| `v_mfma_f32_32x32x16_fp8_fp8` | **REJECTED** | OK |
| `v_cvt_pk_fp8_f32` (the FP8 decoder) | **REJECTED** | OK |
| `v_mfma_f32_16x16x16f16` (what Triton actually emits) | **OK** | OK |

**That is not the end of it, and an earlier draft of this document was wrong to
say CK "cannot be built for CDNA2 at all".** The intrinsic is guarded, not
required (`ck/utility/amd_xdlops.hpp:1442`):

```cpp
#if defined(__gfx94__)
    reg_c... = __builtin_amdgcn_mfma_f32_16x16x32_fp8_fp8(...);
#else
    vector_type<f8_t, 8> reg_a_v(reg_a);
    vector_type<f8_t, 8> reg_b_v(reg_b);
    static_for<0, 8, 1>{}([&](auto k) {
        float reg_a_f32 = type_convert<float>(reg_a_v.template AsType<f8_t>()[Number<k>{}]);
        float reg_b_f32 = type_convert<float>(reg_b_v.template AsType<f8_t>()[Number<k>{}]);
        intrin_mfma_f32_16x16x4f32<16, 16>::Run(reg_a_f32, reg_b_f32, reg_c);
    });
#endif
```

So CK has a software fallback for targets with no FP8 MFMA, and it is
dequant-based like everything else here. Forcing the CK path on gfx90a
(bypassing `_hip_blockscale_supported`) **builds in 315 s and runs**.
Disassembling the gfx90a code object out of the module's `.hip_fatbin`:

```
module_gemm_a8w8_blockscale.so  (gfx90a bundle)   1,266,761 instructions
    MFMA    : {'v_mfma_f32_16x16x4f32': 12288}
    FP8/BF8 : NONE
```

Real matrix instructions, no FP8 opcodes — CK's FP8 GEMM needs no FP8 hardware.

**But it computes the wrong answer.** Against a dequantized reference it returns
mean relative error 0.750000 at every shape tried, with ~1.7% NaN. The scale
layout is not the cause: the error is identical with all-ones scales, where
layout cannot matter, and under all four transpositions of the two scale
tensors. The number is exact for a reason:

```
CK vs full K reduction   : 0.750003
CK vs full/4             : 0.001417      <- bf16 rounding, i.e. equal
CK vs full/2             : 0.500006
```

**CK computes exactly one quarter of the correct result.** The fallback feeds a
single scalar per lane to `intrin_mfma_f32_16x16x4f32`, a K=4 matrix
instruction, so three of every four K lanes contribute nothing — and the
uninitialised lanes are where the NaNs come from. This is an upstream CK defect
on any target without FP8 MFMA, and belongs next to the LLVM register-allocator
hang the INT8 work found (`docs/20`).

It would not be worth using even if it were correct: `v_mfma_f32_16x16x4f32` is
**fp32** MFMA, which on CDNA2 runs at ~45 TFLOP/s against 181 for fp16/bf16. CK
would start a factor of 4 behind Triton on arithmetic alone, while paying the
same emulated `f8 -> f32` conversions.

> **No CK timings are quoted here, deliberately.** A first pass did time it
> against Triton and bf16 and produced a plausible-looking table (CK 1.2-2.3x

So the answer to "is AITER's FP8 block GEMM dequant-based or
FP8-hardware-dependent" is **dequant-based in every implementation that
compiles** — CK included. The ASM `fp8gemm_blockscale` family is the genuine
exception: those are prebuilt gfx942 blobs containing FP8 opcodes the assembler
refuses for gfx90a, and no source fallback applies.

Enabling the AITER kernel on gfx90a is still not worth a gate change: it routes
to Triton, the same class of kernel vLLM already uses, and the CK alternative
behind it is broken.

### It does not need FP8 hardware

Called with an explicit config (the arch's config file is missing — see below),
aiter's Triton blockscale kernel runs and is exact:

```
M=64    N=5120   K=5120    RAN  mean_rel_err=0.00000  CORRECT
M=256   N=7168   K=5120    RAN  mean_rel_err=0.00000  CORRECT
M=4096  N=5120   K=5120    RAN  mean_rel_err=0.00000  CORRECT
```

Disassembling the code it generated (`llvm-objdump -d --mcpu=gfx90a` on the
`.hsaco` Triton emitted, the same technique used to build
[`19-aiter-operator-port-matrix.md`](19-aiter-operator-port-matrix.md)):

```
_gemm_a8w8_blockscale_kernel ... GRID_MN_2560 ...
    MFMA instructions : {'v_mfma_f32_16x16x16f16': 128}
    FP8/BF8 opcodes   : NONE
```

No `v_cvt_pk_fp8_f32`, no `v_mfma_*_fp8_*`. The kernel loads FP8, decodes to
fp16 in registers, and multiplies with the fp16 matrix cores gfx90a has had
since CDNA1. **The design is dequant-based, exactly as hypothesised — a
weight-only FP8 GEMM never needed FP8 arithmetic.**

### Why it still fails out of the box

```
AssertionError: Required config file doesn't exist:
  .../aiter/ops/triton/configs/gemm/gfx90a-GEMM-A8W8_BLOCKSCALE.json
```

Only `gfx1201` ships one. This is a hard assert, not a warning — which is why
the kernel is unreachable rather than merely slow.

---

## 2. The bottleneck is the FP8 decoder, not the tiling

The 128 MFMA above sit inside **11,604 instructions**. vLLM's own kernel is the
same shape:

| kernel | total | MFMA | `v_cmp_ne_u16` + `v_cndmask_b32` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `_w8a8_triton_block_scaled_mm` (vLLM) | 11,997 | 64 | 7,106 |
| `_gemm_a8w8_blockscale_kernel` (aiter) | 11,604 | 128 | 6,984 |

A `v_cmp`/`v_cndmask` pair is a branchless conditional select. Thousands of them
in a GEMM inner loop is not addressing arithmetic; it is a decision tree. It is
the IEEE-correct `e4m3 -> fp16` conversion, open-coded: one branch per
infinity, NaN and denormal case, per value.

Isolating it in a kernel that does nothing but convert confirms the cost and
pins it to the format:

| source dtype | VALU ops to decode 4 values | decoded with |
|---|---:|---|
| `e4m3fn` (OCP) | 117 | software emulation |
| `e4m3fnuz` (AMD) | 118 | software emulation |
| `e5m2` (OCP) | **11** | `v_lshl_or_b32` — a shift |
| `int8` | **11** | `v_cvt_f16_i16_sdwa` — hardware |

Two things follow.

**AMD's `fnuz` format does not help.** It drops inf and negative zero, which is
where one might expect the saving to come from, but Triton's lowering is
essentially identical — 118 ops against 117. Requantizing a checkpoint to fnuz
would buy nothing.

**The problem is e4m3's exponent, not FP8 as such.** e5m2 has 5 exponent bits
and bias 15 — byte-identical in layout to fp16's exponent field — so decoding it
is a left shift. e4m3 has 4 exponent bits and bias 7, so every value needs
re-biasing and the denormal boundary moves.

This corrects the conclusion in
[`benchmarks/vllm-aiter-asm-gfx90a.md`](../benchmarks/vllm-aiter-asm-gfx90a.md),
which read the missing-config warning and inferred that tuning was the blocker.
The warning is real and tuning does help, but an 11.6x gap was never going to be
a tiling problem: the kernel was spending ~99% of its instruction budget
decoding its inputs.

---

## 3. The fix: decode e4m3 with three instructions

The expensive conversion is expensive because it is exact for inputs that
block-quantized weights cannot contain. Reinterpreting the bits is nearly free:

```
e4m3fn:  s eeee mmm          (exponent bias 7)
fp16:    s eeeee mmmmmmmmmm  (exponent bias 15)

h = ((u & 0x80) << 8) | ((u & 0x7f) << 7)
```

This puts the 4 exponent bits at 13:10 and the 3 mantissa bits at 9:7, producing
a valid fp16 that carries bias 15 where the value assumed bias 7. The result is
therefore exactly `2^-8` times the true value — and exactly so for denormals
too, since an e4m3 denormal (exponent field 0) maps to an fp16 denormal and the
same factor applies. Folding `2^8` per operand back in — one multiply by 65536
on the fp32 accumulator, per output element, outside the K loop — restores the
true product.

Verified over the entire input domain, not sampled:

```
exact on all 254 non-NaN bytes: max_abs_diff=0.0
NaN bytes [127, 255] decode to [480.0, -480.0] (expected, unused)
```

The two NaN patterns decode to +-480.0 rather than NaN. Block-quantized weights
contain no NaN, and the dispatch predicate refuses anything that is not a plain
e4m3 `[128,128]` block-scaled GEMM with fp32 scales.

### What it costs and what it buys

| kernel | instructions | MFMA | cmp/cndmask |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `_w8a8_triton_block_scaled_mm` | 11,997 | 64 | 7,106 |
| bit-trick decode | **3,954** | 64 | **194** |

Same 64 MFMA instructions, same arithmetic, same operand layout, same launch
config — 3x fewer instructions and 36x less conditional-select traffic.

Timed on an MI210 (free card; the second MI210 hosts an unrelated model and was
verified idle), Qwen3-14B projection shapes, output checked against a
dequantized reference on every call:

| M | N | K | bf16 us | stock Triton us | bit-trick us | speedup vs stock | vs bf16 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 7168 | 5120 | 88.1 | 1134.0 | **204.3** | 5.6x | 2.3x slower |
| 32 | 5120 | 5120 | 71.6 | 1142.6 | **183.7** | 6.2x | 2.6x slower |
| 256 | 5120 | 5120 | 145.4 | 2250.0 | **322.5** | 7.0x | 2.2x slower |
| 4096 | 5120 | 5120 | 2570.8 | 27975.7 | **5005.1** | 5.6x | 1.9x slower |

Mean relative error against the dequantized reference is `1e-6` at every shape —
**identical to the stock kernel's own error**, which is the point: this is not a
precision-for-speed trade.

Re-checked on real `Qwen/Qwen3-14B-FP8` tensors rather than synthetic Gaussians,
since the only data-dependent risk is that operands 2^-8 smaller reach fp16's
denormal range:

| projection | N | K | fast vs fp32 ref | stock vs fp32 ref | fast vs stock |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `layers.0.self_attn.q_proj` | 5120 | 5120 | 0.001408 | 0.001408 | 0.000001 |
| `layers.20.mlp.gate_proj` | 17408 | 5120 | 0.001410 | 0.001410 | 0.000002 |
| `layers.39.mlp.down_proj` | 5120 | 17408 | 0.001404 | 0.001404 | 0.000002 |
| `layers.39.self_attn.o_proj` | 5120 | 5120 | 0.001407 | 0.001407 | 0.000001 |
| `layers.5.mlp.down_proj` | 5120 | 17408 | 0.001408 | 0.001408 | 0.000004 |

The 0.0014 is bf16 output rounding and is the same for both kernels; the two
disagree with each other by at most `4e-6`. The denormal concern is real but
immaterial: values that underflow are below 2^-15 of the block maximum, and a
block is scaled so its maximum is 448.

The remaining ~2x against bf16 is the honest ceiling area. On CDNA2 FP8 and bf16
share one 181 TFLOP/s peak, so FP8 can never *beat* bf16 here; the goal is to
match it while holding 1.75x less weight memory.

## 4. Does tuning close the gap?

Partly, and it composes with the decode fix rather than substituting for it.

Full config sweep (480 configurations: `BLOCK_SIZE_M/N/K`, `GROUP_SIZE_M`,
`num_warps`, `num_stages`), every configuration checked against a dequantized
reference before being timed, winner re-checked before its number is quoted.
All times in microseconds on one MI210, Qwen3-14B projection shapes.

M = 1, 32 and 4096 were swept over the full 480-config space; M = 8, 128 and
1024 over a reduced 64-config space (`--quick`), which is why a few of their
"tuned" cells are marginally *worse* than the default config — the reduced space
does not always contain the default. Those cells are marked by the bold falling
on the stock column. The two largest prefill shapes at M=4096 were not swept;
see "Not done".

The M=1 / M=8 / M=32 columns for `vLLM stock` are 1140 / 1149 / 1150 us — the
kernel takes the same time for 32x the work. That flatness was the original
tell, and it survives into the fast kernel in muted form (207 / 183 / 192),
because at those sizes both are launch- and bandwidth-bound rather than
arithmetic-bound.

Reading it:

* **Tuning alone recovers 2.6-5.4x** and leaves FP8 at 3.0-4.6x slower than
  bf16. Real, and worth having, but not the answer.
* **The decode fix alone, untuned, beats the exhaustively tuned stock kernel**
  at every shape — 207.2 vs 372.6 at M=1 `qkv_proj`. That is the cleanest
  statement of which problem was the big one.
* **Together they reach 0.59-1.78x of bf16**, from 11.4-16.1x.
* **aiter's kernel is faster than vLLM's at decode** once tuned (204.5 vs 372.6
  at M=1 `qkv_proj`), because its config schema exposes `NUM_KSPLIT` and its
  winner splits K 8 ways. That advantage inverts by M=128, where split-K stops
  paying and aiter's narrower tile choice costs it (4031.6 vs 2604.7 on
  `gate_up_proj`). It is a Triton kernel either way, and behind the decode fix
  at every M.
* **The crossover where FP8 stops beating bf16 sits between M=32 and M=128.**
  On `gate_up_proj`, the largest weight matrix, FP8 is 0.58-0.59x at M=1-8,
  0.76x at M=32, and 1.61x by M=128. Below the crossover the GEMM is bound by
  streaming weights and FP8 moves half the bytes; above it the GEMM is bound by
  arithmetic, where FP8 and bf16 share one 181 TFLOP/s ceiling and the decode
  work is pure overhead. This is the same shape as the INT8 result in
  [`20-int8-gemm-gfx90a.md`](20-int8-gemm-gfx90a.md) — 4.3x at M=16, a wash at
  M=4096 — and for the same reason.

### FP8 beats bf16 at decode, which the arithmetic argument does not predict

"FP8 cannot beat bf16 on CDNA2 because they share one 181 TFLOP/s peak" is
correct about arithmetic and wrong about decode. At M=1 the GEMM is not
arithmetic-bound at all, it is bound by streaming the weights — and FP8 weights
are half the bytes. Hence 0.59x at `gate_up_proj`, the largest weight matrix
in the model.

Adding split-K to the fast kernel (partial sums into an fp32 buffer via global
atomics) pushes this further at decode, most at the layers with the longest
reduction:

| layer | M | bf16 | fast tuned | fast + split-K | best NUM_KSPLIT | weight-stream bound |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| qkv_proj | 1 | 91.8 | 112.5 | **95.1** | 8 | 22.9 |
| o_proj | 1 | 72.2 | **78.5** | 83.8 | 16 | 16.4 |
| gate_up_proj | 1 | 451.2 | **265.5** | 283.2 | 4 | 111.4 |
| down_proj | 1 | 229.7 | 242.0 | **131.9** | 16 | 55.7 |

`down_proj` has K=17408, the longest K in the model, and gains 1.8x. The
"weight-stream bound" column is the time to read the FP8 weights once at
1.6 TB/s — still 2-4x below what any of these kernels achieve, so decode
headroom remains.

Split-K is **not** in the shipped patch. It needs an fp32 scratch buffer, global
atomics (so summation order stops being deterministic) and a `NUM_KSPLIT` key
that vLLM's stock config schema does not carry. The simple kernel already
delivers the bulk of the win; split-K is the obvious next step, with the numbers
above to justify it.

### The activation quantizer is not a second bottleneck

`per_token_group_quant_fp8` encodes bf16 -> e4m3, the direction that also lacks
hardware. It is a flat ~17.5 us at decode sizes (launch-bound, not
conversion-bound) — 2.8-15% of the GEMM and 0.2-1.0% at prefill. vLLM uses a
custom HIP op there, not a Triton FP8 cast, so it never hit the emulation path.

## 5. End-to-end: does it show up in serving?

Yes — 8.6-10.8x. Same harness, model and server flags as
[`benchmarks/vllm-aiter-asm-gfx90a.md`](../benchmarks/vllm-aiter-asm-gfx90a.md)
part 3, so the rows are directly comparable. `Qwen/Qwen3-14B-FP8`, one MI210,
`stock` config on both sides, so the GEMM is the only difference. Full grid:
prompt 128 and 4096 at concurrency 1/8/32.

| prompt | conc | FP8 before | **FP8 after** | gain | bf16 stock | FP8 / bf16 |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 128 | 1 | 2.7 | **29.2** | **10.8x** | 39.1 | 0.75x |
| 128 | 8 | 19.6 | **168.8** | **8.6x** | 197.6 | 0.85x |
| 128 | 32 | not run | **468.2** | — | 608.1 | 0.77x |
| 4096 | 1 | 2.1 | **18.6** | **8.9x** | 27.0 | 0.69x |
| 4096 | 8 | not run | **36.9** | — | 50.7 | 0.73x |
| 4096 | 32 | not run | **43.2** | — | 64.9 | 0.67x |

Output tok/s. The three "not run" cells were never measured before because FP8
was too slow to be worth the wall time. bf16 is the `stock` column from part 2,
the correct comparison since neither side has ASM attention.

TTFT and TPOT, the numbers that show *where* it changed:

| prompt | conc | TTFT before | TTFT after | TPOT before | **TPOT after** | bf16 TPOT |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 128 | 1 | — | 108.4 | 373-383 | **33.7** | 25.3 |
| 128 | 8 | — | 1401.3 | 373-383 | **36.7** | 38.4 |
| 128 | 32 | — | 1724.2 | — | **55.1** | 45.4 |
| 4096 | 1 | — | 2382.3 | 373-383 | **35.4** | 26.2 |
| 4096 | 8 | — | 8146.7 | — | **153.0** | 118.0 |
| 4096 | 32 | — | 19645.1 | — | **586.9** | 394.2 |

TPOT was pinned at 373-383 ms in *every* FP8 cell before, independent of prompt
length and concurrency — the signature of a kernel doing no useful work. It now
tracks load the way bf16 does, and at 128:8 it is actually **below** bf16's.

### Memory, which is the entire point

| | weights | KV cache | KV tokens |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| bf16 | 27.52 GiB | 26.25 GiB | 172,000 |
| FP8 | **15.71 GiB** | **38.08 GiB** | **249,568** |
| ratio | **1.75x less** | 1.45x more | **1.45x more** |

Unchanged by this work — the patch only alters how the GEMM decodes weights, not
how they are stored — but it is the reason the throughput number matters. FP8
now serves at **0.67-0.85x of bf16 while fitting 1.45x more context**, where
before it was 0.07x and the trade was indefensible.

### Did the GEMM win translate?

Yes, and this is worth recording explicitly, because the last kernel measured on
this box did not. ASM paged-attention decode was **1.72x in isolation** and
**~1.1-1.5%** in serving, because it was not the bottleneck. Here the GEMM was
5.5-6x faster untuned and ~10x with tuning, and serving moved 8.6-10.8x — the
full amount. The difference is that the FP8 GEMM *was* the bottleneck: TPOT
being constant at 373 ms regardless of batch size said so before any kernel was
touched, and that is the signal worth trusting next time.

Against the bar the team set — FP8 within 10-20% of bf16 while keeping 1.75x
weight memory — the 128-token cases land at 0.75-0.85x and clear it at
concurrency 8. The 4096-token cases sit at 0.67-0.73x and do not. Prefill is
compute-bound, where FP8 provably cannot beat bf16 on CDNA2, so that gap is
structural rather than a tuning deficit.

---

## 6. Verdict

**The FP8 question on CDNA2 is not closed by hardware.** The earlier conclusion —
that FP8 works, keeps its memory saving, but is unusable for serving — was
correct as a measurement and wrong about the cause. It was not the missing
tuning config, though that config was genuinely missing and worth ~3x. It was
that gfx90a has no FP8 *decoder* instruction, so Triton emulated `e4m3 -> fp16`
at ~29 VALU ops per value and the GEMM spent ~99% of its instruction budget
unpacking its inputs.

Three instructions of bit manipulation, exact over every byte a block-quantized
checkpoint can contain, remove that. With the tuned configs it takes FP8 serving
from 0.07x of bf16 to 0.73x, and takes the decode GEMM itself to **below** bf16
on the largest projections.

On the AITER question specifically: **leave the gate closed.** Not because the
kernel needs FP8 hardware — the one gfx90a can reach does not — but because on
this arch it resolves to a Triton kernel that the patched vLLM path already
beats. `AiterFp8BlockScaledMMKernel` would be worth reaching on gfx942, where it
is CK or ASM. Here it is neither.

And on "would CK be faster than Triton for FP8 here": **no, twice over.** CK's
FP8 path on gfx90a is numerically broken — it computes exactly a quarter of the
sum — and even repaired it would run its matmul on fp32 MFMA at ~45 TFLOP/s
against the 181 that Triton reaches through fp16, while paying the same emulated
conversions. There is no version of this where CK wins on CDNA2. The
format-matching question the team raised turns out not to bite: the rowwise CK
module cannot serve a block-quantized checkpoint, but the block-scaled one that
can is the one that is broken.

### What shipped

* [`configs/enable_fast_fp8_dequant_gfx90a.py`](../configs/enable_fast_fp8_dequant_gfx90a.py)
  — the kernel and its dispatch predicate, gated to ROCm + `on_gfx9() and not
  on_mi3xx()` + e4m3fn operands + fp32 scales + `[128,128]` blocks. Anything
  else falls through to the stock kernel untouched. `--check` and `--revert`
  round-trip to a byte-identical file.
* [`configs/mi210-fp8-block-configs/`](../configs/mi210-fp8-block-configs/) —
  tuned configs in vLLM's on-disk format, for the four Qwen3-14B shapes. Copy
  into `vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/utils/configs/`. These are tuned
  for the fast kernel; without the patch they are still valid, just not optimal.
* [`benchmarks/bench_fp8_fast_dequant_gfx90a.py`](../benchmarks/bench_fp8_fast_dequant_gfx90a.py)
  — the four-way comparison and config sweep that produced the tables above.
* [`benchmarks/probe_fp8_convert_cost_gfx90a.py`](../benchmarks/probe_fp8_convert_cost_gfx90a.py)
  — the convert-only measurement that pins the cost to e4m3.
* [`benchmarks/probe_ck_fp8_blockscale_gfx90a.py`](../benchmarks/probe_ck_fp8_blockscale_gfx90a.py)
  — builds CK's block-scaled FP8 GEMM for gfx90a, disassembles it out of the
  fatbin, and demonstrates the quarter-sum defect.

### Not done

* Split-K, measured and worth 1.8x more on `down_proj` at decode (above).
* Shapes beyond Qwen3-14B have no tuned configs; the sweep script generates them.
* The `M=4096` row covers `qkv_proj` and `o_proj` only — the sweep was stopped
  before the two largest prefill shapes, which are the least interesting case
  (prefill is compute-bound, where FP8 provably cannot beat bf16).
* The **rowwise** CK module (`module_gemm_a8w8`) was not rebuilt with its FP8
  half restored. It shares the identical broken intrinsic in
  `ck/utility/amd_xdlops.hpp`, so it would exercise the same defect, and being
  rowwise it cannot serve a block-quantized checkpoint even if fixed. Worth 35
  minutes of build time only if someone wants that confirmed separately.
* The CK quarter-sum defect is worth reporting upstream, alongside the LLVM
  register-allocator hang from [`20-int8-gemm-gfx90a.md`](20-int8-gemm-gfx90a.md).
